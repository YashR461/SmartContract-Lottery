# You are tasked with designing a Solidity smart contract called TweetContract that simulates a basic social media platform's
# functionalities. The contract should allow users to post tweets, send messages, follow other users, and manage access
# permissions. Implement the following:

## 1. Tweeting:
    • Create a function to allow users to post a tweet. This function should store the tweet's content, the author's address, and
    the timestamp of creation.

## 2. Messaging:
    • Implement a function that enables users to send messages to other users. It should record the sender, recipient, message
    content, and creation timestamp.

## 3. Following Users:
    • Develop a function that enables a user to follow another user by adding their address to a list of followed users.

## 4. Access Control:
    • Implement mechanisms to control access:
        ⚫ Allow users to authorize other users to post tweets or send messages on their behalf.
        ⚫ Allow users to revoke these authorizations.

## 5. Retrieving Data:
    • Create functions to retrieve:
        ⚫ The latest tweets posted by users, considering a specified count.
        ⚫ The latest tweets of a specific user, considering a specified count.

## Run and Test :
Use Remix Ide to run test and deploy.
